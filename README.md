### Local dev

Install dependencies, start parcel server:

```
npm install && npm run dev
```

This will output files to a /dist folder just for local development purposes.

### Building for prod

```
npm run build
```

### Test out how prod built files are looking

```
npm run serve
```

This will start a local server that's serving the built files.

### Deployment

Repo is setup to deploy via github pages with whatever is in the /docs folder.
